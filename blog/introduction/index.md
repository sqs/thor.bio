  Welcome to Thor's blog. An example of rendering Markdown in Deno Fresh.
---

Hi there, welcome to my Blog. We'll it isn't really a blog just yet, for now it is just an example of how to render markdown files in [Deno Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/). If you're interested, you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/thorwebdev/thor.bio).

You might have also noticed that it's a blatant copy of the [Deno Fresh Website](https://fresh.deno.dev/), which awesomely happens to be fully [open source](https://github.com/denoland/fresh/blob/main/LICENSE), so a big thank you to the Deno Fresh authors!

I haven't written any personal blogs in a while, so I'd recommend that you check out the [Showcase](/showcase) section instead, which is a collection of my more recent work at Supabase and previously at Stripe, luckily many of them are open-source \o/

I've also added the blogposts from my previous Gatsby site (ohh those were the times :D) just for completeness sake and because every once in a while someone aks for [the story of how I moved to Singapore](/blog/archive/2019-09-17-moving-to-singapore). You can find them in the archive section below.

But for now, enjoy this little site and come find me over on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thorwebdev) for more frequent updates.
